# üëê Get your connection string

To load the dataset into your cluster, you will first need your connection string to MongoDB.

To get your connection string, go back to the Atlas UI, and look for the **Connect** button.

This will provide you with a modal that offers a number of different ways to connect to your database.

Select **Compass**. While we won't be using Compass to import the data, it's an easy way to see your connection string.

Look for your connection string. It should look something like

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/
```

Click on the copy button next to it to copy it to your clipboard, and store it somewhere safe. You will need this connection string in a number of places throughout this training.

:::tip
Don't forget to replace `<password>` with the password you set when you created the cluster.
