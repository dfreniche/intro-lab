# ðŸ¦¸ Connect With Compass

You can start exploring the dataset using Compass. If you haven't installed the tool yet, you can follow the instructions in the [additional tools](/docs/mongodb-atlas/additional-tools) section.

Once Compass is installed, you can get your connection string, as specified in the [get your connection string](/docs/importing-data/get-connection-string) section.

Explore the data, and try to answer the following questions:

- What are the main collections, and what are the relationships between them?
- Which collection is the largest? Which one has the potential to grow the most?
- Can you see some patterns that you wouldn't see in a traditional RDBMS?
